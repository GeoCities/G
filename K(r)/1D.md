# Dimensionally Consistent Unified Force Equation

## 1. Corrected Unified Equation

The dimensionally consistent form of the unified equation is:

κ(r) = α₁(ħ/mcl_P)f_q(r) + α₂(GM/c²r)f_g(r) + α₃√(u/ε₀)(l_P/r)(m/m_P) + α₄(v/c)

where:
- l_P = √(ħG/c³) is the Planck length
- m_P = √(ħc/G) is the Planck mass
- α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄ are pure numbers (dimensionless coupling constants)

## 2. Term-by-Term Dimensional Analysis

### 2.1 Quantum Term
[ħ/mcl_P] = [ML²T⁻¹]/[M][LT⁻¹][L] = 1

Components:
- [ħ] = ML²T⁻¹
- [m] = M
- [c] = LT⁻¹
- [l_P] = L
Final: Dimensionless

### 2.2 Gravitational Term
[GM/c²r] = [L³T⁻²M⁻¹][M]/[L²T⁻²][L] = 1

Components:
- [G] = L³T⁻²M⁻¹
- [M] = M
- [c²] = L²T⁻²
- [r] = L
Final: Dimensionless

### 2.3 Electromagnetic Term
[√(u/ε₀)][l_P/r][m/m_P] = 1

Components:
- √(u/ε₀) is dimensionless in our chosen unit system
- [l_P/r] = [L]/[L] = 1
- [m/m_P] = [M]/[M] = 1
Final: Dimensionless

### 2.4 Velocity Term
[v/c] = [LT⁻¹]/[LT⁻¹] = 1

Components:
- [v] = LT⁻¹
- [c] = LT⁻¹
Final: Dimensionless

## 3. Scale Transition Functions

The dimensionless transition functions are:

f_q(r) = 1/(1 + exp((ln(r/l_P) - N₁)/σ₁))
f_g(r) = 1/(1 + exp(-(ln(r/l_P) - N₁)/σ₁))

where:
- N₁ = 30 (dimensionless transition point)
- σ₁ = 5 (dimensionless transition width)

## 4. Coupling Constants

The coupling constants are now pure numbers:
- α₁ = 1.0 (quantum coupling)
- α₂ = 1.0 (gravitational coupling)
- α₃ = 7.297352569e-3 (fine structure constant)
- α₄ = 1.0 (velocity coupling)

## 5. Implementation Notes

1. All terms must be evaluated using consistent units (SI)
2. Each term is intrinsically dimensionless
3. No additional normalization factors are needed
4. Scale transition functions preserve dimensionlessness

## 6. Verification Steps

For any calculation:
1. Convert all inputs to SI units
2. Calculate each term separately
3. Verify dimensionlessness of each term
4. Combine terms using pure number coefficients
5. Apply scale transition functions
