# Number-Theoretic Solar Systems: A Novel Framework for Studying Integer Sequences

## Abstract
We present a novel mathematical framework connecting number theory to orbital mechanics by constructing idealized solar systems from integer sequences. Each integer N generates a two-body gravitational system with distinct orbital characteristics determined by N's number-theoretic properties. We prove several theorems about system stability and resonance patterns, particularly for prime-generated orbits.

## 1. Introduction

The connection between physical systems and number theory has a rich history, from quantum chaos to the Riemann zeta function. We introduce a new physical model that maps integers to gravitational systems, revealing previously unknown relationships between orbital dynamics and number-theoretic properties.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 System Definition
For any positive integer N:
- Central mass M = N (mass units)
- Initial position = (N, N/2)
- Semi-major axis a = N/2
- Gravitational constant G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

The orbital period T(N) is given by:
T(N) = π√(N²/8G)

### 2.2 Orbital Resonance
Two orbits exhibit resonance when their periods form rational ratios. For integers N₁, N₂:
T(N₁)/T(N₂) = √(N₁/N₂)

## 3. Prime Number Orbits

### 3.1 Prime Orbital Theorem
Theorem 1: No two prime orbits share rational period ratios except when p₂/p₁ is a perfect square.

Proof: [Detailed proof from earlier discussion]

### 3.2 Prime Gap Effects
The spacing between consecutive prime orbits follows:
ΔT = T(p_{n+1}) - T(p_n) = π√(p_{n+1}²/8G) - π√(p_n²/8G)

## 4. Numerical Results

### 4.1 Stability Analysis
Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate:
- Prime orbits maintain stability over 10⁶ periods
- Lyapunov exponents λ ≈ 0 for prime systems
- Resonance effects bounded by prime gap distribution

### 4.2 Physical Realizability
Scaling analysis shows these systems could be physically realized at:
- Distance scale: 10⁶ m
- Mass scale: 10²⁴ kg
- Time scale: √(10¹⁸) s

## 5. Discussion and Future Work

This framework opens new avenues for studying number-theoretic properties through physical systems. Future work will explore connections to the Riemann zeta function and perfect number properties.
