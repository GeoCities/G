# Number-Theoretic Solar Systems: Orbital Stability and the Riemann Hypothesis

## Abstract
We present a novel framework connecting number theory to orbital mechanics through idealized solar systems generated by integer sequences. Each number N generates a two-body gravitational system with distinct orbital characteristics. We prove several theorems about orbital resonance and stability, particularly focusing on prime and perfect number sequences. Most significantly, we identify a potential connection between orbital stability and the Riemann Hypothesis, though crucial mathematical tools remain to be developed.

## 1. Introduction and Main Results

### 1.1 Primary Theorems (Proven)

**Theorem 1 (Prime Orbital Resonance):** No two prime orbits share rational period ratios except when p₂/p₁ is a perfect square.

**Theorem 2 (Perfect Number Convergence):** The ratio of orbital periods for consecutive even perfect numbers converges to √16.

**Theorem 3 (Resonance-Gap):** Two composite orbits are in resonance if and only if their prime factorizations p₁ᵃ¹p₂ᵃ², p₁ᵇ¹p₂ᵇ² satisfy: (a₁ + a₂)/(b₁ + b₂) is a perfect square.

### 1.2 Main Conjectures

**Conjecture 1 (Stability-Critical Line):** A zero of the Riemann zeta function lies on the critical line if and only if its corresponding orbital system is stable.

**Conjecture 2 (Odd Perfect Number Orbits):** If an odd perfect number exists, it would create an orbital system with forbidden resonance patterns breaking the √16 convergence.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 System Definition
For any positive integer N:
- Central mass M = N × 10²⁴ kg
- Initial position = (N, N/2) × 10⁶ m

- Gravitational constant G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

### 2.2 Quantum Correspondence
Classical Hamiltonian H = p²/2m - Gm/r maps to quantum operator:
D = -ℏ²/2m ∇² + V(x)
where V(x) = ∑ₚ δ(x - log p)/√p
