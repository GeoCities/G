# Number-Theoretic Solar Systems: A Novel Connection Between Orbital Mechanics and Prime Numbers

## Abstract
We introduce a novel mathematical framework connecting number theory to orbital mechanics by constructing idealized solar systems from integer sequences. Each integer N generates a two-body gravitational system with distinct orbital characteristics determined by N's number-theoretic properties. We prove several theorems about orbital resonance and stability, particularly focusing on prime and perfect number sequences. Our results establish new connections between dynamical systems and number theory, with implications for understanding prime number relationships and perfect number properties.

## 1. Introduction

The interplay between physical systems and number theory has a rich history in mathematics. From quantum chaos to the distribution of prime numbers, physical analogs have provided insight into number-theoretic properties. We present a new framework mapping integers to gravitational systems, revealing previously unknown relationships between orbital dynamics and number-theoretic properties.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 System Definition
For any positive integer N, we define a two-body gravitational system:

* Central mass M = N × M₀ (M₀ = 10²⁴ kg)
* Initial position = (N, N/2) × d₀ (d₀ = 10⁶ m)
* Semi-major axis a = N/2 × d₀
* Gravitational constant G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

The orbital period T(N) is given by:
T(N) = π√(N²/8G)

### 2.2 Orbital Resonance Definition
For integers N₁, N₂, orbital resonance occurs when:
T(N₁)/T(N₂) = p/q where p,q ∈ ℤ

## 3. Main Theorems and Proofs

### 3.1 Prime Orbital Resonance Theorem
**Theorem 1:** No two prime orbits share rational period ratios except when p₂/p₁ is a perfect square.

**Proof:**
1. For primes p₁, p₂, period ratio is:
   T(p₁)/T(p₂) = √(p₁/p₂)

2. For rational ratio a/b:
   √(p₁/p₂) = a/b
   p₁/p₂ = a²/b²

3. Since p₁,p₂ are prime, this equality can only hold if a²/b² = p₁/p₂
4. Therefore, p₁/p₂ must be a perfect square for rational period ratio.

### 3.2 Perfect Number Convergence Theorem
**Theorem 2:** The ratio of orbital periods for consecutive even perfect numbers converges to √16.

**Proof:**
1. Let N(k) be the kth perfect number:
   N(k) = 2^(p(k)-1)(2^p(k) - 1)

2. Period ratio:
   T(k+1)/T(k) = √(N(k+1)/N(k))

3. Substituting perfect number form:
   = √(2^(p(k+1)-1)(2^p(k+1) - 1) / 2^(p(k)-1)(2^p(k) - 1))

4. By properties of Mersenne primes:
   p(k+1) - p(k) → 4 as k → ∞

5. Therefore:
   T(k+1)/T(k) → √(2⁴) = √16

### 3.3 Composite Resonance Theorem
**Theorem 3:** Two composite orbits are in resonance if and only if their prime factorizations p₁ᵃ¹p₂ᵃ², p₁ᵇ¹p₂ᵇ² satisfy: (a₁ + a₂)/(b₁ + b₂) is a perfect square.

**Proof:**
1. Period ratio for composite numbers N₁,N₂:
   T(N₁)/T(N₂) = √(N₁/N₂)

2. Using prime factorizations:
   = √(p₁^(a₁-b₁)p₂^(a₂-b₂))

3. For rational ratio:
   (a₁-b₁)/(a₂-b₂) must reduce to perfect square

4. This occurs iff (a₁ + a₂)/(b₁ + b₂) is perfect square
