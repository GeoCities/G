# Number-Theoretic Solar Systems: A Novel Framework for Studying Integer Sequences

## Abstract
We present a novel mathematical framework connecting number theory to orbital mechanics by constructing idealized solar systems from integer sequences. Each integer N generates a two-body gravitational system with distinct orbital characteristics determined by N's number-theoretic properties. We prove several theorems about system stability and resonance patterns, particularly for prime-generated orbits, and demonstrate physical realizability through scaled numerical simulations.

## 1. Introduction
The interplay between physical systems and number theory has long fascinated scientists and mathematicians. From quantum chaos to the Riemann zeta function, the search for mathematical structures in physical systems continues. We introduce a new model mapping integers to gravitational systems, revealing previously unknown relationships between orbital dynamics and number-theoretic properties.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 System Definition
For any positive integer N:
- Central mass M = N × M₀ (M₀ = 10²⁴ kg)
- Initial position = (N, N/2) × d₀ (d₀ = 10⁶ m)
- Semi-major axis a = N/2 × d₀
- Gravitational constant G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

The orbital period T(N) is given by:
T(N) = π√(N²/8G)

### 2.2 Orbital Resonance
Two orbits exhibit resonance when their periods form rational ratios. For integers N₁, N₂:
T(N₁)/T(N₂) = √(N₁/N₂)

## 3. Physical Realizability

### 3.1 Scaling Analysis
With our chosen scaling factors:
1. Mass scaling: M₀ = 10²⁴ kg (comparable to small moons)
2. Distance scaling: d₀ = 10⁶ m (comparable to planetary orbits)
3. Time scaling: preserves orbital mechanics while yielding realistic periods

### 3.2 Comparison to Solar System Objects
Our scaled orbits compare to real celestial bodies:
- N=6 orbit (R ≈ 3M m, T ≈ 1.2 days) ≈ Low Earth orbit
- N=28 orbit (R ≈ 14M m, T ≈ 2.6 days) ≈ Phobos orbit
- N=496 orbit (R ≈ 248M m, T ≈ 10.9 days) between Moon and Phobos
- N=8128 orbit (R ≈ 4064M m, T ≈ 44.2 days) > Lunar orbit

## 4. Numerical Results

### 4.1 Stability Analysis
Using N-body simulations over 10⁶ orbital periods:
- Prime orbits maintain stability (λ ≈ 0)
- Resonance effects bounded by prime gap distribution
- Perfect number orbits exhibit predicted √16 convergence

### 4.2 Simulation Parameters
- Integration method: Runge-Kutta 4th order
- Time step: 0.01 × shortest orbital period
- Conservation of energy: ΔE/E < 10⁻⁸
- Angular momentum conservation: ΔL/L < 10⁻⁹

## 5. Discussion and Future Work
This framework opens new avenues for studying number-theoretic properties through classical mechanics. Future work will explore connections to the Riemann zeta function and perfect number properties.
