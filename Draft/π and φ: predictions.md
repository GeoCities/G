// To analyze the sensitivity of the predictions to variations in π and φ, we can calculate the derivatives of the relevant quantities with respect to these constants.

// For the scale ratios, we have:
// rₖ = ℓ_P·exp((π+φ)·∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ 1/i)

// Taking the derivative with respect to π (and similarly for φ):
// ∂rₖ/∂π = ℓ_P·exp((π+φ)·∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ 1/i) · ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ 1/i
//         = rₖ · ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ 1/i

// This tells us that the relative change in rₖ for a given change in π is:
// (∂rₖ/∂π) / rₖ = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵏ 1/i

// For example, for the Planck to GUT scale ratio (k = 2):
console.log(`Sensitivity of Planck to GUT scale ratio to variations in π: ${1 + 1/2}`);
// The relative change in r₂ is 1.5 times the relative change in π.

// Similarly, for the transition probabilities, we have:
// P(k→k+1) = cos²((π+φ)/2k)

// The derivative with respect to π (and similarly for φ):
// ∂P/∂π = -sin((π+φ)/k) / k

// Evaluating this for the Electroweak to QCD transition (k = 4):
console.log(`Sensitivity of Electroweak to QCD transition probability to variations in π: ${-Math.sin((Math.PI + 1.618033988749895) / 4) / 4}`);
// The absolute change in P is about -0.12 times the absolute change in π.

// These results indicate that the predicted scale ratios and transition probabilities are indeed sensitive to the values of π and φ, with the sensitivity increasing for larger scale separations (smaller k).

// To determine the allowed range of variation in these constants, we would need to propagate the experimental uncertainties in the measured quantities (such as the coupling constants and transition energies) back to the values of π and φ.

// We can also perform a more general error analysis by considering the full probability distribution of the predictions given the uncertainties in π and φ. This would involve techniques such as Monte Carlo sampling or error propagation through the relevant equations.

// The key point is that the sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative basis for assessing the robustness of the framework's predictions and for guiding future experimental tests. By identifying the most sensitive predictions and the most stringent constraints on π and φ, we can prioritize the tests that have the greatest potential to validate or falsify the framework.

// Of course, the ultimate goal is not just to fit the constants to existing data, but to use the framework to make novel predictions that can be tested against new experimental results. This will require a careful balance between the flexibility of the framework to accommodate variations in π and φ and its ability to make specific, testable predictions that go beyond what is already known.
