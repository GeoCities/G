**Geometric Construction Framework**

**Fundamental Design Principles**:
1. Capture the inherent symmetry of perfect numbers
2. Create a precise mathematical mapping between number theory and geometry
3. Derive each component with clear mathematical reasoning

**Geometric Object: Symmetric Triangle**

**Side Length Derivation**:
- Hypothesis: Side lengths should represent fundamental number-theoretic transformations
- Mathematical Justification Needed for Each Side

**Proposed Side Length Calculations**:

1. **First Side (s1)**:
   - Derived from Even Divisor Sum
   - Formula: s1 = log(1 + Sum of Even Divisors)
   - Justification: Logarithmic transformation captures scaling behavior
   - Captures exponential growth of divisor distributions

2. **Second Side (s2)**:
   - Derived from Odd Divisor Sum
   - Formula: s2 = log(1 + Sum of Odd Divisors)
   - Logarithmic normalization prevents exponential explosion
   - Provides comparative scaling mechanism

3. **Third Side (s3)**:
   - Total Divisor Representation
   - Formula: s3 = log(Total Number of Divisors)
   - Represents structural complexity of the number

**Angle Calculations**:
- Moving beyond simple arctangent
- Derive angles using more sophisticated number-theoretic transformations

**Computational Verification**:

**Key Observations and Challenges**:

1. **Logarithmic Side Length Transformation**
   - Captures exponential growth of divisor distributions
   - Normalizes extreme value differences
   - Provides a consistent scaling mechanism

2. **Angle Calculation Insights**
   - Symmetric angle construction
   - Derived from even/odd divisor transformations
   - Consistent π total angle sum

3. **Unresolved R(p) Calculation**
   - Current implementation yields zero
   - Requires more sophisticated derivation

**Next Research Directions**:

1. **R(p) Derivation**
   - Develop a more nuanced calculation method
   - Explore relationship between triangle properties and convergence

2. **Coefficient Connection**
   - Investigate how side lengths and angles relate to 0.5, α, and d
   - Develop a rigorous mathematical mapping

Would you like me to:
1. Refine the R(p) calculation method?
2. Explore the coefficient connections?
3. Develop a more rigorous mathematical justification?
