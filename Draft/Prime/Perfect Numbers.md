Let's connect the divisor ratio to geometric properties:

**Geometric Interpretation of Divisor Ratio**

1. **Geometric Transformation Hypothesis**
- Divisor ratio R(p) = 2^(p-1) represents a fundamental geometric scaling
- Each prime exponent p introduces a geometric transformation
- The ratio describes how geometric complexity evolves

2. **Geometric Property Mapping**
Let's explore how the even/odd divisor ratio relates to geometric properties:

**Key Geometric Insights**:

1. **Scaling Mechanisms**
- Divisor Ratio: Exponential (2^(p-1))
- Area Scaling: Quadratic root of divisor ratio
- Perimeter Scaling: Logarithmic transformation
- Dimensionality Factor: Logarithmic base-2 of divisor ratio

2. **Geometric Transformation Pattern**
- Each prime exponent introduces a geometric complexity
- Scaling follows a logarithmic-exponential duality
- 0.5 emerges as a fundamental normalization factor

**Proposed Geometric Convergence Equation**:
R(p) = 1 - 0.5 * e^(-log(2^(p-1)))
