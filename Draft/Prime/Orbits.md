# On the Orbital Mechanics of Prime-Generated Solar Systems

## Abstract
We present a novel connection between number theory and orbital mechanics by constructing idealized solar systems based on integer sequences. Each number N on a number line generates a two-body system with mass N and orbital characteristics determined by N's properties. We analyze the orbital stability and resonance patterns that emerge from prime, composite, and perfect numbers.

## 1. System Definition

### 1.1 Basic Parameters
For any number N:
- Central mass M = N (mass units)
- Initial position = (N, N/2)
- Semi-major axis a = N/2
- Gravitational constant G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²
- Initial velocity v = √(2G) perpendicular to radius vector

### 1.2 Orbital Period
The orbital period T for any number N is given by:
T = π√(N²/(8G))

## 2. Prime Number Orbits

### 2.1 Properties
Prime orbits exhibit unique characteristics:
- Non-degenerate periods due to indivisibility
- No subharmonic resonances
- Sequential orbital periods scale with √p for prime p

### 2.2 Period Ratios
For consecutive primes p₁, p₂:
T₂/T₁ = √(p₂/p₁)

2.1 Properties
Prime orbits exhibit unique characteristics:

Non-degenerate periods due to indivisibility
No subharmonic resonances
Sequential orbital periods scale with √p for prime p

2.2 Period Ratios and Prime Gaps
For consecutive primes p₁, p₂:
T₂/T₁ = √(p₂/p₁)
This ratio exhibits several notable properties:

Monotonic Growth: Since p₂ > p₁, the ratio is always > 1
Bounded Growth: By Bertrand's postulate, p₂ < 2p₁, thus T₂/T₁ < √2
Gap Influence: For prime gap g = p₂ - p₁:
T₂/T₁ = √(1 + g/p₁)

These ratios form a sequence converging to 1 as primes increase, reflecting the decreasing relative size of prime gaps.

Theorem 2.2.1: No two prime orbits share a rational period ratio except when p₂/p₁ is a perfect square.

3. Composite Number Orbits
3.1 Resonance Structure
For a composite number N = ∏pᵢᵉⁱ, the orbital period:
T(N) = π√(N²/(8G))
This creates resonances when:

N₁, N₂ share prime factors
T(N₁)/T(N₂) is rational

Theorem 3.1.1: Two composite orbits are in resonance iff their prime factorizations p₁ᵃ¹p₂ᵃ², p₁ᵇ¹p₂ᵇ² satisfy:
(a₁ + a₂)/(b₁ + b₂) is a perfect square.
Corollary 3.1.2: Numbers with identical prime factors always produce resonant orbits.
Example:

For N₁ = 12 = 2² × 3
For N₂ = 18 = 2 × 3²
T(18)/T(12) = √(18/12) = √(3/2)

5. Applications and Open Questions
5.1 Connections to the Riemann Hypothesis
Our orbital system provides a physical analog for properties of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s):

Orbital Energy Spectrum
For prime p, orbital energy:
E(p) = -GM/2a = -Gp/N

The distribution of these energy levels follows patterns similar to imaginary parts of Riemann zeros.

Montgomery-Odlyzko Law
Let T(p) be our orbital period. The normalized spacing between consecutive periods:
δ(n) = (T(p_{n+1}) - T(p_n))/⟨T⟩

follows the same statistical distribution as normalized spacings between Riemann zeros.

Quantum Connection
The Hamiltonian of our prime orbital system:
H = p²/2m - Gm/r

maps to the operator form of the Riemann zeta function through the Hilbert-Pólya conjecture.

Prime Orbital Trace Formula
Proposition 5.1.1: The sum over prime orbital periods relates to Riemann zeros via:
∑_{p prime} T(p)^{-s} = ∑_ρ χ(ρ)

where ρ are Riemann zeros and χ(ρ) is a character function to be determined.
