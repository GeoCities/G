# On the Orbital Mechanics of Prime-Generated Solar Systems

## Abstract
We present a novel connection between number theory and orbital mechanics by constructing idealized solar systems based on integer sequences. Each number N on a number line generates a two-body system with mass N and orbital characteristics determined by N's properties. We analyze the orbital stability and resonance patterns that emerge from prime, composite, and perfect numbers.

## 1. System Definition

### 1.1 Basic Parameters
For any number N:
- Central mass M = N (mass units)
- Initial position = (N, N/2)
- Semi-major axis a = N/2
- Gravitational constant G = 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²
- Initial velocity v = √(2G) perpendicular to radius vector

### 1.2 Orbital Period
The orbital period T for any number N is given by:
T = π√(N²/(8G))

## 2. Prime Number Orbits

### 2.1 Properties
Prime orbits exhibit unique characteristics:
- Non-degenerate periods due to indivisibility
- No subharmonic resonances
- Sequential orbital periods scale with √p for prime p

### 2.2 Period Ratios
For consecutive primes p₁, p₂:
T₂/T₁ = √(p₂/p₁)
